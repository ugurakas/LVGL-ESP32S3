# LVGL-ESP32S3
In this branch, i made ui device that work in esp32s3 with 128*128 touchpad
That's scaning wifi signals and list it to the starter screen, after that its automaticly connects to the Mqqt server and subscribe it, or it can be replace with the http request
I worked with Smephores to ensure that different processing requests do not conflict in screen transitions
I have created various visual interfaces through Qt design,
Project folders will be updated later
