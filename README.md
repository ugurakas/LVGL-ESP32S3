In this branch, i made ui device that work in esp32s3 with 128*128 touchscreen
That's scaning wifi signals and list it to the starter screen after that, its automaticly connects to the wifi and Mqqt server and subscribe it, or it can be replace with the http request or you can add a screenbox that can list the topics and you can couse the mqtt topics that you will subscribe, its depends to developer.
I worked with Semaphores and the mutex to ensure that different processing requests do not conflict in screen transitions
I have created various visual interfaces through Qt design,
Project folders will be updated later
